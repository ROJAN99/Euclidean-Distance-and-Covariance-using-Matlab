# Euclidean-Distance-and-Covariance-using-Matlab
Matlab project done for my image processing class. This is to calculate Euclidean Distance and Covariance matrix from given n*m matrix.

EDIST.m --> This will calculate euclidean distance using for loops
calculateED.m --> This will provide matrix with euclidean distance using matrix operation
correlation.m --> This will provide correlation matrix using matrix operation
main.m --> Tester file to plot graphs and simulate to given number of random matrix
generateMatrix.m --> This is just a random matrix generator for test purposes

Find a report of this project too.
